    that ID you gave me points to a wrong execution. I'm not stupid, yo.
    {% elif execution.result.confirmation.status == 'too old' %}
    that request is more than two hours old. That's, like, gazillion years in my robotic world. Start a new one!
    {% elif execution.result.confirmation.status == 'same user' %}
    lololol. Nice try, but you can't review and confirm your own request. No ninja stuff. http://i.imgur.com/bW6YOYS.jpg
    {% elif execution.result.confirmation.status == 'duplicate' %}
    don't be so slow. This one is already reviewed.
    {% elif execution.result.confirmation.status == 'success' %}
    nice! I'm getting the gears going. Well, not really, it's just a dry run. Still, congrats for testing this! :heart:

    something went terribly wrong here.
