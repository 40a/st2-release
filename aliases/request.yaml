    let's do it!
    @channel: @{{ execution.user }} wants to do a {{ execution.parameters.type }} release (which would be {{ execution.result.tasks[0].result.result.next }}).
    To make sure we don't screw things up, someone else has to make sure `master` is stable enough and then confirm with `confirm {{ execution.id }}`.
    {% if execution.result.tasks[1].result.result|length %}
    FYI, here's what happened since the last release: {~}
    {% for pr in execution.result.tasks[1].result.result %}
    {{ loop.index }}. {{ pr.title }}: {{ pr.url }}
    {% endfor %}
    {% else %}
    {~}
    {% endif %}
